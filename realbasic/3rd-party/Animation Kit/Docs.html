But animation can be a bit difficult, especially when trying to animate based on times rather than frames.</p>			<p>The ZAZ AnimationKit allows developers to animate interface elements - RectControls and Windows (including ContainerControls) using a single line of code. AnimationKit includes convenience methods to retrieve the bounds of an item as a AKRect structure, and create AKTasks which can be triggered for animation later. AnimationKit also allows customizable frame rates, with a default of 32 frames per second.</p>			<p>Simple or complex animation is now easy, thanks to AnimationKit</p>			<p class="section">Usage</p>			<p>AnimationKit includes a module called AKCore, which handles all aspects of the animations. The principal animation class, AKTask, has no real functionality, and must be subclassed to use. AnimationKit contains two such subclasses to handle nearly any type of animation: AKMoveTask and AKFrameTask. Both are similar, but will be covered separately.</p>			<p>AKTask contains a method, NextTask, to allow animation chaining. It can be treated as a property, and read back. When setting NextTask, the new task will be added to the last task in the chain, allowing very easy chaining. There is also an OnCompleteAction property which points to a AKCompletionDelegate to allow code to be executed when an animation completes. Unlike NextTask, OnCompleteAction does not chain. In AKMoveTasks, OnCompleteAction is called when the object reaches it's final position. In AKFrameTasks, OnCompleteAction is fired when the animation completes it's set of frames, and looping is turned off. If looping is on, then OnCompleteAction will not be called. AKTask also has a Cancel method which will stop the animation where it is, no matter what state it is in.</p>			<p class="section">AKMoveTask</p>			<p>AKMoveTask encapsulates all the functionality of the older AnimationTask. It can be created by manually. or by AKCore.NewMoveTask. It can also be created using the Animate extension of Window or RectControl, though Animate will trigger the animation instantly. AKMoveTask's NewRect method describes the final location of the object, using an AKRect. AKRect can be created manually, or by AKCore.CreateRect. Duration is the number of seconds needed to complete the animation and EasingMethod is any of the constants found in AKEasing to describe the animation style - such as Linear and Bounce.</p>			<p></p>			<p class="section">AKFrameTask</p>			<p>Like AKMoveTask, AKFrameTask can be created manually, by AKCore.NewFrameTask, or using the Animate extension of any class which implements the AKFrameTarget interface. Any class can implement AKFrameTarget, but only classes that do can perform frame animations. AKFrameTasks need to be provided with an array of picture objects. The looping property does exactly what it sounds like: if true, the animation will continue over and over again. If false, the animation will complete once each frame has been displayed, and both NextTask and OnCompleteAction will be triggered. AKFrameTasks have a duration property as well, which describe how long it should take to complete one loop.</p>			<p>AKFrameTargets implement a single method, ChangeFrame which provides both the image to display and the frame index to the implementor. There is also an AKAnimatingCanvas which already implements AKFrameTarget to make it very easy to perform frame animations. For example, a custom progress wheel is no more complicated than providing the canvas the set of images, set looping to true, and run the animation. Looping animations should be stopped using the Cancel method if the window is closing, otherwise you are likely to receive NilObjectExceptions.</p>			<p class="section">Licensing &amp; Usage</p>			<p>Like nearly everything that comes from The ZAZ, this is free and open source. The typical clause applies: do what you wish with this, just don't release any modified code to the public without my consent first. Redistribution is allowed, as long as the archive matches exactly as found the website. Use the checksum.</p>			<p class="section">Contact</p>			<p>Use the website: <a href="http://www.thezaz.com/">http://www.thezaz.com/</a> or my personal address, <a href="mailto:zero@thezaz.com">zero@thezaz.com</a>.</p>			<p class="section">Release History</p>			<p class="subsection">2.5</p>			<ul>				<li>Added AKScrollTask for animating ScrollBars</li>				<li>Added AKResizeTask for resizing controls, much like AKMoveTask, but without option to move them.</li>				<li>Added ConflictResolutionAction property to AKTask and constants AKTask.ResolveAppend and AKTask.ResolveReplace. In the past, conflicting animations would always append to each other. This is the new default. You can set ConflictResolutionAction to ResolveReplace, and a previous animation will be stopped before starting the new one.</p>				<li>Fixed bugs with Cocoa.</li>				<li>AKRect has been removed in favor of REALbasic.Rect.</li>				<li>The Bounds extensions have been renamed ContentRect.</li>			</ul>			<p class="subsection">2.0.0</p>			<ul>				<li>All classes have been renamed to a AKxxx naming convention</li>				<li>Separated AKTask into a &quot;container&quot; class. AKMoveTask replaces AnimationTask.</li>				<li>Added AKFrameTask, AKFrameTarget, and AKAnimatingCanvas to handle frame-based animations.</li>				<li>Added AKCompletionDelegate to trigger code when an animation completes.</li>				<li>Reworked methods to remove need to AKCore.Start and AKCore.Stop methods - this is handled entirely automatically now.</li>			</ul>			<p class="subsection">1.2.0</p>			<ul>				<li>Reworked code to use a completely time-based animation method. With the old method, AnimationCore would calculate the number of frames it would take to complete the animation based on the duration and frames per second. This new method guarantees the animation will complete on the duration.</li>			</ul>			<p class="subsection">1.1.0</p>			<ul>				<li>Added AnimationEasing module, which provides the constants and methods necessary for animation styles. Special thanks to Stephen Tallent for porting this module to REALbasic.</li>				<li>Added NextTask property to AnimationTask, allowing chained animation.</li>				<li>Moved the Run method from AnimationTask to AnimationCore. If an AnimationTask for an object is already in the queue, Run will attempt to assign it to NextTask of the existing AnimationTask. This will cause the new animation to run once the current one is finished. If the current task already has a NextTask, Run will not overwrite it, and will then return false.</li>				<li>Changes to demo project to support new features.</li>			</ul>			<p class="subsection">1.0.1</p>			<ul>				<li>Renamed Rect to AnimationRect to avoid problems caused by namespaces and certain plugins.</li>			</ul>			<p class="subsection">1.0.0</p>			<ul>				<li>Initial release.</li>			</ul>		</div>	</body></html>
